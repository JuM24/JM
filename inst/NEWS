Changes in version: JM_0.7-0

  * the new function rocJM() has been added that calculates time-dependent
ROC curves and the corresponding AUCs for joint models.

  * methods "weibull-AFT-GH", "weibull-PH-GH", "piecewise-PH-GH", and 
"spline-PH-GH" support now the derivative parameterization.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.6-2

  * a small bug was corrected in summary.jointModel().


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.6-1

  * jointModel() has now the extra argument 'scaleWB' tha allows to fix the
scale parameter for the Weibull baseline hazard to a specific value.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.6-0

  * method = "spline-PH-GH" allows now to include statification factors for 
which different spline coefficients are estimated. By default the knots positions 
are the same across strata -- this can be changed by either directly specifying the 
knots or by setting the control argument 'equal.strata.knots' to FALSE.

  * the new function wald.strata() can be used to test for equality of the spline 
coefficients among strata.
  
  * a confint() method has been introduced for 'jointModel' objects.

  * jointModel() has now the extra argument 'lag' that allows for lagged effects in
the time-dependent covariate represented by the linear mixed model.

  * a bug was corrected in joint models with piecewise constant baseline risk function. 
In particular, the 'xi' parameters were reported as double their actual value.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.5-0

  * function dynC() has been added that calculates a dynamic concordance index 
for joint models.

  * method = "ch-GH" has been replaced by method = "spline-PH-GH" that fits a relative 
risk model with a B-spline-approximated baseline risk function.

  * method = "ph-GH" that fits a relative risk with an unspecified baseline risk function 
has been renamed to method = "Cox-PH-GH".


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.4-0

  * function survfitJM() has been added that calculates predictions of subject-specific 
probabilities of survival given a history of longitudinal responses.

  * the multiple-imputation residuals now work also for joint models with piecewise constant 
baseline risk functions.

  * faster optimization algorithms have implemented for 'method = "weibull-PH-GH"' and 
'method = "piecewise-PH-GH".


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.3-0

  * the Weibull model is now available under both the relative risk and accelerated failure 
time parameterizations.

  * a number of enhancements have been implemented in the functions that compute the MI-based 
residuals.

  * new more robust algorithms have been written for the numerical approximation of integrals; 
this will lead to some discrepancies in the results, especially in the survival part, compared 
to the previous versions of the package.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.2-1

  * changes in e-mail addresses.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.2-0

  * the jointModel method for the residuals generic has further options: (i) MI residuals for fixed 
and random visit times for the longitudinal process, and (ii) martingale, Cox-Snell, and AFT residuals 
for the survival process.

  * Function weibull.frailty() is introduced (along with supporting methods) for fitting multivariate 
survival data using the Weibull model with Gamma multiplicative frailties under maximum likelihood.

  * several typos have been corrected in .Rd files.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.1-1

  * corrected some typos in .Rd files.
