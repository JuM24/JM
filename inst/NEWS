Changes in version: JM_0.5-0

  * function dynC() has been added that calculates a dynamic concordance index for joint models.

  * method = "ch-GH" has been replaced by method = "spline-PH-GH" that fits a relative risk model with a B-spline-approximated baseline risk function.
  
  * method = "ph-GH" that fits a relative risk with an unspecified baseline risk function has been renamed to method = "Cox-PH-GH".


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.4-0

  * function survfitJM() has been added that calculates predictions of subject-specific probabilities of survival given a history of longitudinal responses.

  * the multiple-imputation residuals now work also for joint models with piecewise constant baseline risk functions.

  * faster optimization algorithms have implemented for 'method = "weibull-PH-GH"' and 'method = "piecewise-PH-GH".


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.3-0

  * the Weibull model is now available under both the relative risk and accelerated failure time parameterizations.

  * a number of enhancements have been implemented in the functions that compute the MI-based residuals.

  * new more robust algorithms have been written for the numerical approximation of integrals; this will lead to some discrepancies in the results, especially in the survival part, compared to the previous versions of the package.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.2-1

  * changes in e-mail addresses.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.2-0

  * the jointModel method for the residuals generic has further options: (i) MI residuals for fixed and random visit times for the longitudinal process, and (ii) martingale, Cox-Snell, and AFT residuals for the survival process.

  * Function weibull.frailty() is introduced (along with supporting methods) for fitting multivariate survival data using the Weibull model with Gamma multiplicative frailties under maximum likelihood.

  * several typos have been corrected in .Rd files.


==============================

Changes in version: JM_0.1-1

  * corrected some typos in .Rd files.
